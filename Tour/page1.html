              <h2>Testimonials</h2>
              <p>This was my first time out of the country and first time using a travel agency and let me tell you the experience I had with Brenda was best in class from the beginning to the end. Everything was thoroughly laid out, she answered all my questions, her follow-up great, and very detailed oriented. While in Australia and New Zealand we didn't have to wait for anything and all our reservations was clearly identified in the 3rd party company systems which made this trip hassle free.</p>
              <p>Julie and John M.</p>
